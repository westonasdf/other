/*
 * ImperialLength.h
 *
 * This class implements imperial measurements (inches and feet).
 *
 * Currently the class allows you to create an imperial length object using
 *  either feet and inches, or total inches.
 *
 *  You will be adding support for the operators +, =+, -, and =-
 *
 *  You will also be adding support for the << operator.
